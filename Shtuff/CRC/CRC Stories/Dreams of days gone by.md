Nia: Mama... when are you getting out of the hospital?
???: Soon, sweetie.
Nia: You shouldn't be lying this time!
???: *laughs* of course I'm not! When I get out, let's see the stars.
Nia: mmm!

Liar.

N: I haven't asked for the reason for you coming home now... aren't you busy this time of year?

F: I can't miss that day. You know that.

N: ... I can come with papa.

F: Uncle's too busy to come with you this time of year. Plus, didn't we all agree that it's us who visits her on her death anniversary?

N: I know that! Still, you didn't have to go.

F: *sigh* Don't you get bad dreams this time of year? I assume it's why you're in that "cuddle pile" and not your room.

N: ..! ... Fine, let's do a visit this week.

= SEQ END =

=ACT3=

F: @crc_nia, you ready?

N: mmh. Let's go to the forest.

|30 minutes|

N&F arrive in a clearing.

N: We're here. *Nia approaches and vanishes in thin air*

F: *Follows and arrives at the same place Nia disappeared into* This always surprises me.

|They arrive at a version of the forest clearing, with sakura trees surrounding a gravestone|

N: *approaches the grave and silently cleans the gravestone*

F: *Lights a cigarette and puffs it, before looking up at the sky.*

N: *Nia continues cleaning the grave, without looking,* ... Didn't papa tell you to stop that?

F: It's just for this day.

N: *Nia finishes cleaning the grave, places a boquet of flowers and sits beside it, looking at the sky in silence*

F: It's beautiful here isn't it?

N: She always loved the stars.

F: Do you think she joined them?

N: Of course... I miss her Fifi.

F: *Fia inhales more of the cigarette smoke* ...We all do Nini.
