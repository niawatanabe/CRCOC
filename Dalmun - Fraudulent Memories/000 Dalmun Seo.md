Quick Summary: Experimented on by her family, Mun is trapped in a simulation of sorts. Forced to live a recreation of history as Dalmun, a being outside of time, through virtual reality. Due to this, and the body modifications that have been done to her, Mun's mind is a mix between the millenia she lived and her experiences amongst a family that treats her as merely a test subject.
