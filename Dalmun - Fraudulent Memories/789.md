In the year 839...

Hugubert Vitus von Boas the 7th campaigned war against the Wessex in the hopes of the unification of England.

Along with his right-hand man, Sir Leo Kirchenbauer the 6th, they proceeded a campaign against their long time enemy, Egbert Bartelmeu the 9th.

While initially finding success, Hugubert's forces suffered increasing losses. Particularly, the battle of 842 was a crushing defeat in their part.

With the continous losses and the morale at an all time low, Hugubert was slowly driven mad by the war. Hugubert's attitude changed as the war went on, earning Leo's fear. Eventually however, they were able to achieve a descisive victory in the year 857.

Celebrating the victory, Hugubert's troops held a banquet. Amongst the festivities, Hugubert gave his closest allies a special meal.
