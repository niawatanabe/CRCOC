Subject: Seo 'Mun' Dalmun (서달문)
Age: 25 (1997), Physically 16
Living Family Members: N/A

Project Head: ███ ██████
Project Status: TERMINATED

Summary:
Seo Dalmun (which, from this point on, will be referred to as the subject) was acquired at the age of 10. Immediately upon acquisition, the project was put into motion. The project aims to create the perfect human, using genetic modifications. The project also aims to create faux omniscience - using an accurate simulation of human history to achieve this.


Physical Modifications:
Using CRISPR technology, the subject's cells were reprogrammed to remove or minimize various "errors" in th human genome. This includes the apparent Genomic Instability that is brought about by cell division. These include:

- Telomere Attrition,
- Epigenetic Alterations,
- Proteostasis Loss, and
- Cellular Senescence

Among others. These include diseases that appear with age. This allows the subject to remain in the peak of its health without deterioration.

This, however, caused growth to cease. This led to the subject being physically that of a teenager for the rest of its life.

As for other genetic modifications, the subject also has increased muscle and bone density, increased brain capacity, photographic memory, and immunity from all known diseases as of writing.

Memory Modification:
With the team's goals of creating an artificial entity, the subject is subjected to a simulation of death and rebirth as Dalmun. The subject is then made to live a life as an overseer of exactly 5000 years of a recreation of human history. The subject is then made to be sealed in chains around the time of the first crusade (1096-1099 A.D.).  The sheer amount of storage capacity required to store 5000 years of memories might pose an issue in the future, and reliance on the subjects mind wiping old memories is an unfortunate requirement.

Addendum: External Storage has proven to be the most effective solution. As such, the subject has been implanted with a device that allows here to send and receive data from data centers to store and retrieve memories.

To mitigate this issue, the subject is currently placed in stasis, and may be reactivated using the code: ████
		
		 
		 
		
NOTE: WITH THE DISSOLUTION OF THE TEAM, THE PROJECT IS HEREBY TERMINATED. THE FILES WILL REMAIN RESTRICTED TO CLASS-3 LEVEL PERSONNEL.
