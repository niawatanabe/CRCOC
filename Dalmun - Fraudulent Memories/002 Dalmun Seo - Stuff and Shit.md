Trauma:

After being saved, Dalmun finds out about her forged memories. This causes her to question reality, being in something fake for so long. This causes anxiety attacks, especially when she's not connected to the data centers.

When depressed she tends to cry, and stay silent. Seeking physical touch (hugs) as comfort, befitting of her childlike appearance.

Weaknesses:

Her vast knowledge comes from a data center located deep underground. While this can be moved, this will be a slow process.

Mun is connected to this storage system wireless through a special channel. This can be blocked with Lead lined walls and other objects and techniques that cause interference. Doing so will leave Mun with what is currently stored in her brain, which lowers her intelligence (not wisdom) by a fair amount.

Additionaly, Mun's vast knowledge comes from the internet. This allows her to be a walking wikepedia page, albeit the disconnection from the laboratory slowed down this process from instantaneous to a few seconds.

Being one with memories from long ago, Mun is old-fashioned, terribly so. This means that Mun is a boomer.
